# Sentinel's Journal

## 2025-02-18 - [Sentinel Initialization]
**Vulnerability:** N/A
**Learning:** Initialized security journal.
**Prevention:** N/A

## 2025-02-18 - [Shadowed Startup Validation]
**Vulnerability:** Duplicate `lifespan` function definitions in `backend/src/agent/app.py` caused the first definition (containing `check_env_strict()`) to be silently overwritten by the second one.
**Learning:** Python allows redefinition of functions in the same scope without warning, which can lead to critical initialization logic (like security checks) being skipped if they are split across multiple identically-named functions.
**Prevention:** Ensure a single `lifespan` context manager handles all startup/shutdown logic, or use a modular approach where multiple startup hooks are explicitly registered and aggregated.
