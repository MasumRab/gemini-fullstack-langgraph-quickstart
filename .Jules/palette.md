- **Frontend Build Fragility**: The frontend `package.json` was missing several dependencies (`remark-gfm`, `rehype-sanitize`, etc.) required by `ArtifactView.tsx`, causing `npm run build` to fail despite tests passing. This indicates a discrepancy between the dev/test environment and the production build pipeline.
- **Micro-UX Constraints**: Strictly adhering to "one micro-UX change per run" when the repo is already in a broken state (missing deps) is challenging. The decision to prioritize the specific verified fix over fixing the global build (which would require adding 5+ deps) was made to respect the agent's primary directive, but it highlights a need for a separate "maintenance" run to fix the build.
- **ActivityTimeline Testing**: The `ActivityTimeline` component defaults to a collapsed state when populated, necessitating that unit tests explicitly interact with the toggle button to verify list visibility and content.
