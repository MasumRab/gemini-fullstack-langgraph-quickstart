The task I need you to solve is the following:
create longterm planning document for scheduling todo tasks that be iteratively updated to integrate features from the
https://github.com/langchain-ai/ ecosystem

**Update:** A roadmap has been established in `ROADMAP.md`. Please refer to this file for the agreed-upon phases and specific integration tasks.

Original Context & Links:
eg
https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents

first level are opensource alternatives to already implemented features
features such as langchain
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters
https://github.com/langchain-ai/executive-ai-assistant
this repo provides alternative search graph implementations
https://github.com/langchain-ai/local-deep-researcher

or for example the frontend backend implementation in
https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe
allows many smooth interactions which are nicely captured and could be translated into our vite implementation


an extension that could make the frontend and back
https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-canvas
after the first full run of the graph returns a search result to the user.
subsequently the users edits to the returned results could initiate another planning/research/web_search loop

all intergrations should be atomic and modular with definitive code advancements being included into the code base as necessary

some packages/docs that may help are
https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents-quickstarts
https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-google
https://pypi.org/project/langchain-google-genai/

we are not aiming to integrate and implement all these features in this workflow but we do aim to properly document and out line the tradeoffs and details of implementing these workflows.
if possible breakdown the integration plan for each additional feature or code improvement into smaller tasks for later imiplemenations
